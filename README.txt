Angband for Android 4.2.0

=========================

An unofficial port of the roguelike Sil to Android.

This work is based in the excellent port of Angband found here: https://github.com/takkaria/angband-android

The transparent keyboard was borrowed from here: https://github.com/Shaosil/Android-Sil (with modifications)

Recommended game experience is with Landscape Orientation and center-player (in-game) option.

Some keyboard shorcuts:

Long-Press over game view -> Show preferences
"..." -> Hide some keys (pressing a hidden key displays the keyboard again)
Long-Press "..." -> Hide all keys excluding this one
Long-Press "Ctrl^" -> Make the keyboard almost opaque
Long-Press "p" -> Ctrl+P (recall messages)
Long-Press "o" -> Ctrl+F (recall last message)
Long-Press "f" -> Ctrl+F (recall level feeling)
Long-Press "u" -> U (use item)
Long-Press over other keys (most of them) -> shorcut for Hide some keys
