# Angband for Android 4.2.0

An unofficial port of the roguelike Angband to Android.

This work is based on the excellent port of **Angband** found [here](https://github.com/takkaria/angband-android).

The transparent keyboard was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/Shaosil/Android-Sil) (with modifications).

Recommended game experience: Landscape Orientation and center_player option on.

The game has two input methods: the soft keyboard and the button ribbon.

### The soft keyboard

It has three modes (alphanumeric, symbols and control-keys) and several opacity settings to make playing a bit easier on small devices.

### The button ribbon

Accessed when the soft keyboard is hidden, the button ribbon has two modes (command and full).

In command mode, the ribbon contains icons for the most used commands in the game. Some commands perhaps are missing in this mode (zap a rod, aim a wand, etc.), but most of them can be triggered using the Inventory, Alter and Use commands.

It's important to remember that directions can be used to cycle between equipment, inventory, floor and quiver.

To reduce the number of buttons in command mode, the Alter command can also open chests and close doors.

If you feel that some action should be in the ribbon anyway, every keymap defined inside the core Angband is displayed in the button ribbon. This is also handy for spells and repetitive keystrokes.

Enjoy!
