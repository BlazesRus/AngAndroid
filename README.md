# Angband for Android 4.2.0

An unofficial port of the roguelike Angband to Android.

This work is based on the excellent port of **Angband** found [here](https://github.com/takkaria/angband-android).

The transparent keyboard was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/Shaosil/Android-Sil) (with modifications).

Recommended game experience: Landscape Orientation and center_player option on.

Some keyboard shorcuts:

    Long-Press over game view -> Show preferences
    "..." -> Hide some keys (pressing a hidden key displays the keyboard again)
    Long-Press "..." -> Hide all keys excluding this one
    Long-Press "Ctrl^" -> Make the keyboard almost opaque
    Long-Press "p" -> Ctrl+P (recall messages)
    Long-Press "o" -> Ctrl+F (recall last message)
    Long-Press "f" -> Ctrl+F (recall level feeling)
    Long-Press "u" -> U (use item)
    Long-Press over other keys (most of them) -> shorcut for Hide some keys
